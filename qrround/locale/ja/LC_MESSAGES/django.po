"Although this document cannot magically absolve you from the risk of data "
"mismanagement, it is a giant first step. Informing your visitors and "
"customers (and other parties) about the data you collect about them is a "
"requirement. A privacy policy is a simple way to comply, but a good privacy "
"policy goes further. It is prime evidence to everyone with whom you deal "
"that you take confidentiality seriously. That can help increase the trust "
"that visitors and customers have in your business and boost their confidence "
"in using your services or buying from you."
